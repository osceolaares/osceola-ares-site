  - title: How is an emergency response organized?
    content: |
      Osceola County has adopted the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as the
      method by which to control and organize any and all incidents, emergencies and
      disasters. In 2003, Homeland Security Presidential Directive #5 mandated the use of
      the NIMS and its corresponding six core components.

      As a result of NIMS, Osceola County has revised many required plans as well as
      operational methods. Typically, emergency operations centers are organized by emergency
      support functions (ESF) with a coordinating agency responsible for reporting activity
      within the ESF. With eighteen ESF’s in Osceola County, span of control is exceeded
      significantly. To effectively manage these coordinating functions, Osceola County has
      integrated the Incident Command System (ICS) to maximize the benefits of an effective
      management tool. The use of the ICS within the EOC coupled with a multijurisdictional/agency
      Executive Policy Group, Osceola can manage any incident with clear direction, excellent,
      effective planning all while minimizing duplication of efforts. For a complete review of
      Osceola County’s EOC Operational Guidelines, please refer to the CEMP Appendix A.
