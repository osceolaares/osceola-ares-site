Osceola County ARES is saddened to share that **Steve Butler, NO9S**, became a **Silent Key** on **Saturday, January 10th, 2026**.

Steve was a familiar and welcome presence in the amateur radio community and a **long-time supporter of Osceola County ARES**. He generously gave his time and knowledge helping to **maintain our repeaters** and regularly **facilitated and supported ARES nets**, ensuring reliable communications and smooth operations. His quiet dedication behind the scenes made a meaningful difference to the group.

Steve took pride in the amateur radio hobby, enjoyed sharing it with others, and exemplified the spirit of service, cooperation, and fellowship that define both amateur radio and ARES. Whether on the air or in person, his passion for radio and his willingness to help were always evident.

We extend our heartfelt condolences to Steve’s family, friends, and fellow amateur radio operators. His passing is a loss felt throughout our ARES group and the wider amateur radio community.
