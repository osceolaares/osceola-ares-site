Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) is a public service organization comprised of licensed amateur radio operators who voluntarily provide communications support during emergencies and disasters. ARES is part of the Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL) in the United States and similar organizations in other countries.

The main objective of ARES is to establish reliable and effective communication networks when regular communication channels are disrupted or overwhelmed during emergencies. Amateur radio operators, also known as "hams," possess the necessary skills and equipment to establish communication links over various frequencies, including voice, data, and even Morse code.

During emergencies, ARES volunteers work closely with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, to provide crucial communication support. They might assist in relaying messages, coordinating resources, providing situational reports, and supporting the overall response efforts. Their ability to communicate over long distances without relying on traditional infrastructure makes them valuable assets in times of crisis, such as natural disasters, severe weather events, public safety incidents, and other emergency situations.

ARES members often participate in drills, exercises, and training sessions to enhance their skills and ensure they are ready to respond when needed. They also cooperate with other amateur radio organizations and can be part of larger emergency communication networks, such as the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES) and the National Traffic System (NTS).
