As a result of NIMS, Osceola County has revised many required plans as well as operational methods. Typically, emergency operations centers are organized by emergency support functions (ESF) with a coordinating agency responsible for reporting activity within the ESF. With eighteen ESF’s in Osceola County, span of control is exceeded significantly. To effectively manage these coordinating functions, Osceola County has integrated the Incident Command System (ICS) to maximize the benefits of an effective management tool.
